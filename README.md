HTML practice project

## Purpose of this project
- Gain confidence in basic HTML syntax
    - Boilerplate
    - Paragraphs and headings
    - Links
    - Images

## Reflection
The syntax feels more and more natural the longer I use it, which is not so 
surprising.  Also, this has helped demystify the web for me.  I am only 
scratching the surface, but I feel more aware of the fundamental pieces of a 
website.

Also, I know very very little about cooking.
